# Design-of-a-CPU-by-Gated-Circuit
## A project from course Fundamental of digital logic and processor
1. Designed the overall structure of a 32 bit CPU with MIPS instruction set by Vivado;
2. Implemented gate-level design of modules such as Mux, ALU, PC, 32-bit Register and Data Memory;
3. Implemented a single - cycle CPU, a multi - cycle CPU and a pipeline CPU.
